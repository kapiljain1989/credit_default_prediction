# Loan Default Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and report for the Loan Default Prediction project, which aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on historical data.

## Project Overview

The project tackles the challenge of predicting loan defaults for a German bank using a dataset containing 17 features and 1000 customer records. The primary goal is to develop an accurate prediction model that aids in identifying potential defaulters and managing risk.
	•	checking_balance - Amount of money available in account of customers
	•	months_loan_duration - Duration since loan taken
	•	credit_history - credit history of each customers
	•	purpose - Purpose why loan has been taken
	•	amount - Amount of loan taken
	•	savings_balance - Balance in account
	•	employment_duration - Duration of employment
	•	percent_of_income - Percentage of monthly income
	•	years_at_residence - Duration of current residence
	•	age - Age of customer
	•	other_credit - Any other credits taken
	•	housing- Type of housing, rent or own
	•	existing_loans_count - Existing count of loans
	•	job - Job type
	•	dependents - Any dependents on customer
	•	phone - Having phone or not
	•	default - Default status (Target column)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provides context and outlines the project's objectives and research questions.
2. **Methods and Materials**: Describes the data analysis process, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model building. Includes details on the machine learning models used and their evaluations.
3. **Results**: Reports key findings from the analysis, including insights from EDA and the performance of different machine learning models.
4. **Discussion**: Interprets the findings, discusses implications, limitations of the study, and potential future directions.
5. **Conclusions**: Summarizes the main takeaways and insights from the project.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the `code/` directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to replicate the analysis and model building process.

3. The generated visualizations and model performance metrics can be found in the `results/` directory.

4. The final report is available in the `report/` directory in both Docx.

## Dependencies

The code and analysis were conducted using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to have these libraries installed before running the code.
